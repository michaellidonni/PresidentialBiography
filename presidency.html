            <h3>Major Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>
              Upon taking office in 1921, Harding immediately set to work on
              implementing his vision for economic recovery and stability. One
              of his first accomplishments was the establishment of the Bureau
              of the Budget, a key step in organizing and managing government
              finances more effectively. He also worked to pass tax cuts that
              benefited businesses and the wealthy, with the aim of stimulating
              the economy and encouraging investment. Harding’s administration
              also implemented protective tariffs to safeguard American
              industries from foreign competition, and he promoted policies that
              favored economic growth and business development.

            <h3>Conflicts</h3>
            <p>
              Despite these efforts to foster economic recovery, Harding’s
              presidency was overshadowed by scandals that severely damaged his
              reputation. The most infamous of these scandals was the Teapot
              Dome scandal, in which high-ranking officials in Harding’s
              administration were implicated in bribery and corruption related
              to the leasing of federal oil reserves. Additionally, the Veterans
              Bureau scandal revealed widespread mismanagement and fraud in the
              care of war veterans. Although Harding was not personally involved
              in these scandals, they tarnished his presidency and created an
              atmosphere of distrust in his leadership. Harding's reputation for
              honesty and integrity was severely damaged, and these scandals
              became a defining part of his legacy.

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>
              Despite the scandals, Harding’s presidency also saw positive
              developments. He was an advocate for civil rights, speaking out
              against lynching and supporting federal anti-lynching legislation,
              although he was unable to achieve significant legislative
              victories in this area. Harding’s leadership during his presidency
              was marked by a desire to bring stability to a nation recovering
              from war, but his time in office was ultimately cut short by his
              sudden death from a heart attack on August 2, 1923. Harding’s
              death in office meant that he did not have the opportunity to
              complete his second term or fully realize his political ambitions,
              leaving a mixed legacy of both accomplishments and controversies.
