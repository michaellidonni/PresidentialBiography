            <h3>Major Accomplishments</h3>
            <p>
              As soon as Harding took office he instantly starting implementing
              his plan to achieve economic stability. One of his first
              accomplishments was that he made the Bureau of the Budget, which
              organized and managed government finances more effectively. He
              passed tax cuts that benefited businesses and wealthy people, with
              the plan to encourge investment. Harding’s administration also
              implemented protective tariffs to protect American industries from
              foreign competition, and he promoted policies that favored
              economic growth and business development.

            <h3>Conflicts</h3>
            <p>
              Despite his efforts to recover the economy, Harding’s presidency
              is mainly known for the scandals that severely damaged his
              reputation. The most infamous of these scandals was the Teapot
              Dome scandal, in which Albert Fall the Secretary of the Interior
              at the time leased the federal oil reserves in Wyoming out to
              Harry Sinclair and Edward Doheny so they can drill for oil.
              Another scandal was, the Veterans Bureau scandal when millions of
              dollars were embezzeled by Charles R. Forbes. Although Harding was
              not personally involved in these scandals, they tarnished his
              presidency because he appointed all of the people who did these
              scandals and it created distrust in his leadership. Harding's
              reputation for honesty was severely damaged, and these scandals
              became a defining part of his legacy.

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>
              The scandals aside, Harding’s presidency also had positive
              developments. He was a big advocate for civil rights, and he spoke
              out against lynching and supported federal anti-lynching
              legislation, but he was unable to achieve big legislative victory
              in this area. Harding’s leadership during his presidency was
              marked by a desire to bring stability to a nation recovering from
              war, but his time in office was cut short due to his sudden death
              from a heart attack on August 2, 1923. Harding’s death in office
              meant that he did not have the opportunity to have a second term
              leaving behind a legacy of both accomplishments and controversies.
