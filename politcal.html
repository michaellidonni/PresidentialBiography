            <h3>Early Politics</h3>
            <p>
              Harding’s entry into politics was influenced by his early success
              in journalism and his growing interest in public service. He
              joined the Republican Party and began his political career in
              Ohio, serving in the state Senate and eventually becoming the
              Governor of Ohio. During his time in Ohio politics, Harding gained
              a reputation for being a moderate and pragmatic leader. His
              political platform was largely focused on pro-business policies,
              advocating for limited government intervention in the economy, and
              emphasizing the importance of economic growth and stability.

            <h3>Election</h3>
            <p>
              In 1920, Harding ran for president of the United States,
              campaigning on a promise of "return to normalcy" after the turmoil
              of World War I. The United States was facing significant economic
              challenges following the war, and Harding’s message resonated with
              voters who were eager to return to a sense of stability. His
              opponent, James M. Cox, ran on a platform that included support
              for the League of Nations, but Harding’s call for a more
              isolationist approach and his focus on domestic economic recovery
              led to a landslide victory. Harding secured 404 electoral votes,
              while Cox only garnered 127, marking a decisive shift in American
              politics toward conservatism and a preference for isolationism in
              foreign affairs.
