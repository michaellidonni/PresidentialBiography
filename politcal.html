            <h3>Early Politics</h3>
            <p>
              Harding entered poltics after his success in the journalism
              industry. He joined the Republican Party and then served in the
              Ohio state senate. Eventually he worked his way up and became the
              Govener of Ohio. During his time in politics, Harding gained a
              reputation for being a good leader. His political beliefs were
              largely focused on pro-business policies, advocating for limited
              government intervention in the economy, and the importance of
              economic growth and stability.

            <h3>Election</h3>
            <p>
              In 1920 Harding ran for president the main focus of his campaign
              was a "return to normalcy" after World War I. The United States
              was facing economic challenges following the war, and Hardingâ€™s
              message stood out to voters who wanted to return to how things
              used to be. He ran against James M. Cox, who's main focus was
              support for the League of Nations, while Harding wanted a more
              isolationist approach and more of a focus on economic recovery.
              This led to a landslide victory, Harding had 404 electoral votes,
              while James Cox only had 127.
