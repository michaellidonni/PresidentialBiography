            <h3>Education & Career</h3>
            <p>
              Harding attended Ohio Central College and graduated in 1882 with a Bachelor of Science degree. After college Harding was interested in journalism so he then moved to Marion, Ohio, and purchased the local newspaper, the "Marion Star". He brought the newspaper success which developed him a reputation for his skills and ability to manage a business. This experience running a business may have helped to shape his political views, such as his pro-business policies and belief in the importance of a free-market economy.
