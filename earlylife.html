            <h3>Family Life</h3>
            <p>
              Warren G. Harding was born on November 2, 1865, in Blooming Grove, Ohio, to George Tyron Harding and Phoebe Elizabeth Dickerson Harding. His parents were both doctors, and although they were not wealthy, they valued education and hard work. Harding grew up in a modest household with seven siblings, and his upbringing in a small, rural town likely shaped his grounded personality and work ethic. His early years were marked by a strong sense of family, and his parents’ dedication to their professions may have influenced his future interest in leadership roles and public service.

            <h3>Education & Career</h3>
            <p>
              After completing his high school education, Harding attended Ohio Central College, where he graduated in 1882 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Despite his education, Harding was more interested in journalism than in continuing with a formal academic career. He moved to Marion, Ohio, where he purchased the local newspaper, the Marion Star. Under his ownership, the newspaper became financially successful, and Harding developed a reputation for his editorial skills and ability to manage a business. This experience running a business helped to shape Harding’s later political views, particularly his pro-business policies and belief in the importance of a free-market economy.
